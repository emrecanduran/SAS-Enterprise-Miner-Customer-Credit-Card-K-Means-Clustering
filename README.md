# Customer Credit Card Clustering

This repository contains code and data for performing K-means clustering on a customer credit card information dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/credit-card-customer-data). The goal is to group customers based on their credit card behavior and identify patterns or segments within the customer base.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of the following variables:

- `SI_No`: Customer Serial Identification Number (unique)
- `Customer Key`: Customer Reference Key (unique)
- `AvgCreditLimit`: Average Credit Card Limit for the Customer
- `Total_Credit_Cards`: Total Credit Cards Owned by the Customer
- `Total_visits_bank`: Total Number of Bank Visits by the Customer
- `Total_visits_online`: Total Visits Online by the Bank Customer
- `Total_calls_made`: Total Calls Made by the Customer to the Bank

## Methodology

The K-means clustering algorithm was applied to the dataset using SAS Enterprise Miner. K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters based on the similarity of observations within each cluster. The algorithm iteratively assigns observations to clusters and updates the cluster centroids until convergence.

## Repository Contents

- `data/`: This folder contains the dataset used for the analysis. [Specify the source or provide instructions on how to obtain the dataset if it's not included.]
- `code/`: This folder includes the SAS Enterprise Miner code used to perform the K-means clustering.
- `results/`: This folder contains the output or results of the clustering analysis, such as cluster assignments for each customer.

## Usage

To reproduce the clustering analysis or explore the code and data, follow these steps:

1. [Specify any prerequisites or software requirements, e.g., SAS Enterprise Miner version]
2. [Provide instructions on how to set up and configure the environment, if necessary.]
3. [Describe any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning or feature scaling.]
4. [Explain how to run the SAS Enterprise Miner code or provide a sample command.]
5. [Describe any additional steps or considerations for interpreting the clustering results.]

## Results

The clustering analysis resulted in [number of clusters] distinct customer segments based on their credit card behavior. [Describe the characteristics or patterns observed in each cluster, if applicable.]
